**Smart Calculator App**

This is a Python-based smart calculator application with a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using Tkinter. The application supports various mathematical operations, voice recognition, and arithmetic calculations. It enables users to perform standard calculations and use voice commands for computations.

**Features**

Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
Advanced Operations: Square root, Exponents, Trigonometric functions, Logarithms
Mathematical Constants: Pi (π), Euler's number (e)
Special Functions: Factorial, Modulus, LCM, HCF

**Setup and Requirements**

Ensure you have Python installed.
Install required libraries:
Tkinter
Pygame
SpeechRecognition
Running the Application

Run the main.py file.
The graphical interface will open, providing a calculator-like interface for user input and operations.
Users can perform calculations by clicking the buttons or use the voice recognition feature by clicking the microphone icon.
Functionality Overview

**Basic Operations:** Use the on-screen buttons for basic arithmetic calculations.
Scientific Functions: Perform square roots, trigonometric calculations, logarithms, and more.
Voice Command: Click the microphone icon to activate voice recognition and perform arithmetic calculations using voice commands.
Usage Example

**Basic Arithmetic:** Use the numbers and operators to perform simple calculations.
Scientific Calculations: Utilize functions like square root (√), trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), and logarithms.
Voice Commands: Speak out mathematical operations after clicking the microphone icon.
File Structure

**main.py:** Contains the Python code for the calculator application.
music1.mp3, music2.mp3: Audio files used for sound effects in the app.
logo.png, microphone.png: Images used in the graphical user interface.
Note

Please ensure that the required sound/music files are present in the same directory as the Python script for the sound effects to function correctly.

Feel free to explore, use, and modify the code as needed for your projects or custom applications.
